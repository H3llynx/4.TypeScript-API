##  Learnings and challenges

This was my first project using TypeScript, and it pushed me to learn its core concepts while improving how I structure and reason about my code. I also deepened my understanding of working with external APIs—handling requests and responses.
One of the key new tools I adopted was Zod, which helped me validate and enforce data shapes safely throughout the project. Overall, the experience strengthened both my TypeScript fundamentals and my approach to building more robust applications.
